  abstract =	 {In the classical linear programming problem the
                  behaviour of continuous, nonnegative variables
                  subject to a system of linear inequalities is
                  investigated. One possible generalization of this
                  problem is to relax the continuity condition the
                  variables. This paper presents a simple numerical
                  algorithm for the solution of programming problems
                  in which some or all of the variables can take only
                  discrete values. The algorithm requires no special
                  techniques beyond these used in ordinary linear
                  programming, and lends itself to automatic
                  computing. Its use is illustrated on two numerical
                  examples.},
